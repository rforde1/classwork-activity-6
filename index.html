    <p>A monkey is any primate that is not a human, prosimian (lemurs, sifakas, lorises, pottos, bush babies, and other
        primitive primates), or ape. Monkeys make up two of the three groups of simian primates, Old World monkeys and
        New World monkeys. The other group is the apes.</p>
    <p>Most monkeys eat both animals and plants. Some also eat dirt. Monkeys peel their bananas and do not eat the
        skins. The orangutan is the largest fruit-eating animal in the world and it rarely comes out of the trees.</p>
    <p>Monkeys are seriously threatened by habitat lossâ€“especially those that live in tropical forests, a habitat that
        is quickly disappearing. Twenty-one primate species are listed as critically endangered on the 2007 Red List of
        Threatened and Endangered Species. Forty-seven are endangered and 46 are vulnerable to extinction.</p>
